## [1.2.0] - 05/01/2025

### Added

- Loop + report sequences + Tm + product size from Primer Blast for all generated primers Loop through all primers with SNP Check, reporting the small symbol to know if the pair is okay or not, along with the image of the primers.
- Loop for UCSC In Silico for all primers, reporting the link to directly view the area they target.

### To Do

- Properly use the genome box to switch between hg19 and hg38.
- Systematically retrieve hg38 + hg19 coordinates to create correct data in Defgen.
- Use the Ok checkbox (spoiler alert: it is currently of no use).
- Try to capture an image from Primer Blast, but it seems complicated as it is mainly text and not an image generated by URL like SNP Check.
