# CHANGELOG

## [1.3.0] - 03/03/2025

### Added

- hg19/hg38 coordinates.
- Number of off-target products.
- Two All_In scripts to run everything at once.
- Automatic check of the sequence with the most homology in Primer Blast.

### Changed

- Modified the getDNA_gene script to also report the chromosome, start, and end.
- Modified both getDNA scripts to include a UCSC link to the design area.

### Fixed

- Correct use of the genome in various VBA scripts, with the ability to change it via a dropdown menu.
- Corrected URLs to display text instead of the address to reduce clutter.
- Fixed the Reset script to correctly clear all data from the table.

### Removed

- Cleaned up the SNP_check script and centered the image correctly in the cell.

### Issues

- Random Permission Denied Error 70 when PrimerBlast processes the list of primers; closing IE and restarting the script often resolves the error.
- Object unavailable when the script tries to check seq1 to select the correct sequence; probably due to a "submitting" page appearing before the "running" page.

### To Do

- Use the Ok checkbox in conjunction with the "Order" button that is created ; Partially functional, you can test it.

## [1.2.0] - 05/01/2025

### Added

- Loop + report sequences + Tm + product size from Primer Blast for all generated primers Loop through all primers with SNP Check, reporting the small symbol to know if the pair is okay or not, along with the image of the primers.
- Loop for UCSC In Silico for all primers, reporting the link to directly view the area they target.

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

### Issues

### To Do

- Properly use the genome box to switch between hg19 and hg38.
- Systematically retrieve hg38 + hg19 coordinates to create correct data in Defgen.
- Use the Ok checkbox (spoiler alert: it is currently of no use).
- Try to capture an image from Primer Blast, but it seems complicated as it is mainly text and not an image generated by URL like SNP Check.
